SVG Sprites are a very effective and performant method of adding icons to your
website. Our SVG's are generated by node svg-sprite which compiles all of the
svg's listed in the /svg directory into one file. You can then utilize the <use>
tag to pull certain shapes listed in that file into your website. Make sure that
you are also setting the correct viewBox dimensions from your original svg.

```html_example
    <svg class="svg svg--thearrow" viewBox="0 0 58 96">
      <use xlink:href="../svg/dist/symbol/svg/sprite.symbol.svg#thearrow"></use>
    </svg>
```
*/

// Hologram Styles
.codeExample .svg {
  max-width: 100px;
  margin: auto;
}
